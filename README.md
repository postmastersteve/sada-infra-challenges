## [Challenge 2: Read file and create files and sort](https://gitlab.com/-/snippets/2011945#challenge-2-read-file-and-create-files-and-sort)

My bash script solution to this second challenge can be found as the [challenge-02/run.sh](../blob/main/challenge-02/run.sh) file. It has been tested in a bash shell on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS "Bionic Beaver" and macOS 10.14.6.
